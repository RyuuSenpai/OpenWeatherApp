Current Weather Screen: This screen allows users to search for weather information for any city. They can either use their current location or search for a specific city. Once they select a city, they can view its current weather information, as well as navigate to the Forecast screen to see the upcoming days' weather for the selected city. Additionally, the app remembers the last city searched on this screen, making it easier for users to quickly access the weather information for their preferred locations.
